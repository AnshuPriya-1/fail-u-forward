# Fail U Forward

**Fail U Forward** is a community driven platform where failure is not something to hide but something to celebrate. It’s designed to share honest stories of setbacks and rejections and lessons learned: all the stuff LinkedIn filters out. 

## About 

The idea for Fail U Forward came from scrolling through LinkedIn where everyone’s success stories looked flawless but in reality real growth happens through failure. 
This platform brings those unfiltered, messy journeys to light. 
Whether it’s a failed startup, a rejected interview or a project that just didn’t work out: every post here is a badge of resilience. 
Fail U Forward encourages users to reflect, learn and grow by normalizing failure and building a culture of transparency. 

## Features 

- Post your rejections, failures and real lessons learned
